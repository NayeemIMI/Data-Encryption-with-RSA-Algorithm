# Data-Encryption-with-RSA-Algorithm
Here I have implemented the AES algorithm on Python - 3.

# Technology Used:
-Google Colab

-Python - 3

-Random

-Itertools

-Functools

# Features:
-This program will ask for the RSA key size and the message.

-Then it will generate and print two prime numbers of the size that has given by the user.

-Then the public key and the corresponding private keys will be generated and printed.

-After that the cipher text and the decrypted plain text will be printed.


# Guidelines to Run this Project
-Go to colab.research.google.com

-Create a new notebook.

-Copy everything from my source file and paste in Google colab and run


-Or you can just open my souce file and click "Open in colab" and you can run it from there directly!
